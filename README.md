# Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model that classifies fish species based on various features such as weight, length, height, and width. The model was trained using the Fish Market dataset, and it uses a Random Forest Classifier to make predictions.

# Dataset
The Fish Market dataset used for training the model can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/fish-market?resource=download). It contains information about common fish species found in fish markets, along with their weight and physical measurements.

# Model
The Random Forest Classifier was chosen for this classification task due to its ability to handle multiple features and provide accurate results. The model achieved a classification accuracy of approximately 95% on the test dataset.
